#How have you used AI for coding so far?
I am new to coding so i almost do everything via AI. i love to try different prompt techniques to generate code.

#Do you ask AI for solutions before trying yourself?
i barely code at the moment. all of what i do is with the help of AI at the origin stage, that being said, i try to understand the logic after the code has been generated by AI. 

#Can you explain code you've submitted without AI's help?
I know i can explain basic code for my level. i try to watch Youtube videos for clarity on the logic behind the code.

#What would happen if AI was suddenly unavailable during an exam or interview?
I am confident i can explain code that i write myself without the use of AI so removing AI shouldn't be a problem.

I am a bit of both honestly. I tend to depend on AI for complex tasks, in a situation where i can comprehend the solution, then AI becomes my teacher and learning partner.

#Write a brief paragraph where you are now and where you want to be.

I am a curious thinker who likes to learn new things. I cant wait to start coding and developing projects.
